When a quiet and unsuspecting Anastasia Steele stumbles upon the opportunity to interview the 27-year-old billionaire entrepreneur, she quite literally stumbles through the entire thing, but Grey finds her adorable, and that idea is as shocking to her as it is to him.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=471 data-injectable=true>You see, Grey is a man of very “singular” tastes, which also reads as&nbsp;the guy is a total dom&nbsp;(dominatrix), and there’s not a lot that surprises him, let alone that makes his heart skip a beat. He’s drawn to Ana in a way he’s never been before; if this were&nbsp;Twilight,&nbsp;we’d say that Ana was his own personal brand of heroin; if it were&nbsp;Pride and Prejudice, we’d say Ana bewitched Grey, body and soul.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>However, this is&nbsp;50 Shades of Grey, and Ana absolutely threw Christian for a loop, but he wasn’t the only one. Ana knew she was crossing paths with someone powerful, but he would go on to change her world in a way she never anticipated. It wasn’t just the initial draw they felt to one another; every interaction between them changed things for her, but the film trilogy didn’t receive rave reviews from all audiences.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true>In fact, some were downright troubled by the contents of&nbsp;50 Shades. As&nbsp;Grey himself would say, he was 50 shades of f***ed up, and some in the kink community felt the same way while watching it. Before we get too far into that, however, let’s discuss what you came here for: the watch order for the film trilogy. How do you see each installment of this twisted romance unfold in the right timeline? As usual, we’ve got you covered.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-1-50-shades-of-grey data-injectable=false>1. 50 Shades of Grey</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/50Shades.jpg><p data-characters=504 data-current-count=804 data-injectable=true>First things first, you start with&nbsp;50 Shades of Grey, the film that started it all, inspired by a book of the same name. The story begins with Anastasia Steele meeting Christian Grey, opening the door to the sexual escapades of a billionaire Casanova.&nbsp;Ana’s meeting with Christian was all made possible because her friend and roommate, Kate, could not do an interview with him due to a pretty wicked sickness, but it felt more like fate stepping in to ensure that the paths of these two crossed.</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>We’re not in the business of kink-shaming; life is short, and if it makes you happy (and is legal and consensual), then we say to let your heart desires run wild — but the movie did draw criticism from those who saw it less about embracing your dark desires, and more about glorified abuse.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=719 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Atlantic</a>&nbsp;was one of many publications that spoke about Grey not being a “true dominatrix” and the troubles of the film that paint the BDSM community in an unfair light; there are many “grey” areas of the movie in which Ana notes that she’s only “submitting” to avoid conflict, or because she’s not quite sure how to use her voice yet, where Christian is concerned.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>Speaking to a sex educator in the kink community, The Atlantic notes that this practice isn’t at all how genuine BDSM relationships are conducted. The rules are outlined in black and white from the beginning, even if they’re different for any club, event, or relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>“It could be that ‘the standard is you don’t touch anyone you don’t know without their permission, and you don’t touch anyone’s belongings,’ she says. But, for example, other places might ‘require that all people who identify as submissive address all people who identify as dominant as sir or ma’am.’ No matter what, these guidelines are always explicit. ‘Rules are usually posted online, and then frequently, you can find a hard copy. Some parties you might go to might hand those to you as you go in. I’ve been to parties that make you read and sign standards of behavior as you walk in.’”</p><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=334 data-injectable=false>The thing about 50 Shades of Grey is that it showed more coercing from Grey, and less willing participation from Ana. As the book and film series continued, Ana grew more confident, but communication and understanding are cornerstones of the BDSM community; as E (the sex educator who spoke to The Atlantic) notes, the other is trust.</p><p>“Communication is one of the most important parts of kink and BDSM sex because that’s how partners establish trust. And trust is crucial: It’s why people let others tie them up naked…”</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>Trust and communication would grow more prominent in the relationship between Ana and Christian, but 50 Shades of Grey was certainly the movie that caused most people to feel like something just wasn’t right. With the two separated at the end following a lousy decision on Chrstian’s part, some audiences wouldn’t go on to see the films that followed.</p><h2 id=h-2-fifty-shades-darker data-injectable=false>2. Fifty Shades Darker</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/50ShadesDarker.jpg><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">50 Shades Darker</a></strong> is the second film in the installment, and the movie sees Ana and Christian pick up their relationship after — shocker, we know — they ended things after Christian took it too far in the previous film. This time, the relationship is more on Ana’s terms, which means they have no rules, secrets, or punishments.</p><p data-characters=553 data-current-count=891 data-injectable=true>Ana begins to learn more about Christian’s past, but he doesn’t give her the full run down just yet — and to be honest, it’s heartbreaking to understand what he endured as a child and a young adult. He tells Ana that his mom was a drug user, but for each wall he takes down where his girlfriend is concerned, another sprouts up to hide even darker secrets. Christian didn’t get into his “lifestyle” the way some people do; he was all but forced into it, which Ana learns about halfway through the second storyline.</p><p data-characters=464 data-current-count=464 data-injectable=true>A woman who “took him in” after his mom’s death “introduced” (see also: assaulted) him, and he knew no other life. While his biological mother had never been able to care for him, this woman, Elena, “cared” for him in a way that was wildly inappropriate and illegal, but was still more than he’d been given before. He was confused, but he considered this to be a step up from what he’d faced on his own before.</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>As Ana begins to learn more about him, she understands all of the reasons that Christian has his walls up, and she meets the infamous Elena herself, and in newfound confidence, delivers quite the blow to her ego. The second film, and the book upon which it was based, both end on a happier note.</p><h2 id=h-3-fifty-shades-freed data-injectable=false>3. Fifty Shades Freed</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/50-Shades-Freed.jpg><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">50 Shades Freed</a></strong> sees Christian and Ana living their dream life together, a married couple who still enjoy Christian’s toys and playroom living as quite the powerhouse pair. The past can’t touch them anymore, right? … At least, that’s how it appears at first; what happens next, however, is enough to rock the foundation upon which they’ve finally secured their feet.</p><p data-characters=711 data-current-count=1104 data-injectable=true>A threat from Christian’s past is waiting for the perfect moment to strike, but what this prior adversary doesn’t know is that Christian fought to get to where he is now, and he’s not going to let anyone get in his way, even someone he once shared a close bond with. It goes without saying that the third film is arguably the most emotionally-charged, but it’s also a peek into what healing looks like, even if it’s done in a way that’s less packaged and polished, and more gritty and all-consuming. Ana and Christian finally get to their own little piece of happily ever after, and while it took a lot more than they ever expected, it all appears to be worth it in the end.</p><p data-characters=479 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=false>If you’ve yet to dive into the books that inspired the films, you can find them of the same name, in the same order, by E.L. James at your local bookstore or library. Three additional books written from the perspective of Christian vs. Ana, simply titled Grey, Darker, and Freed, also exist for readers who want a new view of their story. As we explained earlier, there are mentions of BDSM that is nonconsensual, and mentions of sexual abuse, so please read with caution.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXam8bsPArZqhZaSdsm6yyJ%2BrsmWjna6lsdJmpp9ll6eyunnMqK2inaNitq95zqubnqpf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-morgan-romano-miss-usa-crowned-by-miss-universe-rbonney-gabriel-following-latters-rigging-scandal.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Morgan Romano?
