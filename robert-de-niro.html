And <strong>Robert De Niro</strong> is one of those actors who is respected by his colleagues and all generation. Robert is the greatest actor of his era along with a few other actors such as <strong>Al Pacino</strong>, <strong>Daniel Day-Lewis</strong>, <strong>Tom Hanks</strong>, <strong>Dustin Hoffman</strong>, etc.</p><p>Being a recipient of several prestigious awards, De Niro is best known for his movies such as <i>The Godfather Part II, Taxi Driver, The Deer Hunter, Raging Bull, Heat</i>, etc. Through his 57 years of professional acting, Robert achieved such stardom which only a few actors are lucky to see. Now, let's know about his latest news, projects, and personal life.</p><h2>21 Years of Marriage ended in Divorce</h2><p>The 77-year-old actor has been married twice and has six children from three different women, two of them being his ex-wife. First of all, let's know what happened with his second marriage which ended in 2018. Robert was married to <strong>Grace Hightower</strong>, an actress, singer, philanthropist, and socialite.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/12/13/RobertGrace-1607866726970.jpg><p>They first met at Mr. Chow, an upscale London Chinese restaurant in 1987. The place is also known for celebrity hangouts. At the time, Grace was working there and she began dating De Niro. After ten years of relationship, Robert and Grace married in 1997. Their son, <strong>Elliot De Niro</strong> was born in 1998, but a year later, Robert filed for divorce and they began living separately.</p><p>After a short time, the couple resolved their issues and renewed their vows in 2004. In 2011, they welcomed their daughter, <strong>Helen Grace De Niro</strong> via surrogate. Unfortunately, Robert and his wife of 21 years, Grace divorced in <i>December 2018</i>. On <i>February 14, 2020,</i> the former spouses <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>reached</strong></a> a child-custody agreement regarding their daughter.</p><h2>Hightower wanted half of Robert's Wealth</h2><p>In mid-2019, Grace Hightower filed some paperwork required during their ongoing divorce. The legal filing showed some of the intimate details regarding their finances and assets. As per Grace's filing, Robert's fortune is at least <strong>$500 million</strong>. Despite a 2004 prenup agreement, Hightower demanded half of her ex-husband's net worth which is <strong>$250 million</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/12/13/Robgr-1607866871513.jpg><p>The couple's 2004 prenup stated that Grace would be paid <strong>$1 million</strong> as alimony, a <strong>$6 million</strong> apartment, <strong>$500,000</strong> cash, and half of the value of their primary residence. After knowing Robert's actual wealth, Grace filed motions asking for 50% of her ex's wealth.</p><p>In <i>July 2020</i>, Grace filed a complaint against Robert saying that he cut her monthly allowance from <strong>$100,000</strong> down to <strong>$50,000</strong>. Later, the judge ordered the actor to pay the full sum.</p><h2>First Marriage to Diahnne Abbott</h2><p>Robert's first wife was <strong>Diahnne Abbott</strong>, an actress, and singer. The two first met while filming Taxi Driver, where Abbott played a supporting role. They got married in 1976 and welcomed a son named, <strong>Raphael</strong>. He is a real estate broker and former actor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/12/13/RobDia-1607867123445.jpg><p>De Niro also adopted, <strong>Drena</strong>, Abbott's daughter from her previous relationship. Drena is an actress and filmmaker. After 12 years of marital relationship, Robert and Diahnne parted their ways.</p><h2>Dated Toukie Smith</h2><p>After his first divorce, Robert began dating, <strong>Toukie Smith</strong>, an actress, and model.
