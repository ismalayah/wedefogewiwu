The two are now quarantining together with their family People were the first to report the news.</p><p>”I mean, I am 50. It didn’t seem it would be in the cards for me,” “I had always been so focused on my career. [Marriage] wasn’t something I thought of.”</p><p>The two first met on the dating app Bumble about two years ago.&nbsp;Stuart said he had no idea the lady he matched with was a Food Network star.</p><p>Burrell said:</p><p>“When they made Anne, they broke the mold,”&nbsp; “It was a wonderful surprise. You know, on social, the photos are never as good as the real thing. When she sat down in front of me, I was like, ‘Wow, she’s so hot.’”</p><p>Burrell said she was equally smitten. When the coronavirus shutdowns happened, the couple decided to quarantine in Burrell’s hometown to be near her mother. Claxton had already been planning a proposal but decided he needed to come up with a plan to pop the question in quarantine.</p><p>Stuart told the media that:</p><p>“Fortuitously, I brought the ring,” “Anne’s mother has a townhouse and lovely apartment. I asked her for permission to ask Anne to marry me and we then started planning and getting things together.”</p><p>With the help of Anne’s 75-year-old mother, Claxton set up a romantic dinner date in the townhouse for the couple.</p><p>“Anne’s mom dressed up the room and decorated it and set the table. It was better than I would have come up with myself,” “We had a lovely dinner. I kept bringing the conversation around to our past and relationship and kept getting these bemused looks from Anne.” Finally, he got down on one knee and Burrell enthusiastically said yes.</p><p>Burrell said:</p><p>“We finished dinner and I had to clean myself up because I was bawling,”&nbsp; “And then we met up with everyone else. My mom had Champagne ready and we had a toast and that was really fun.”</p><p>Burrell said the “silver lining” of getting engaged in quarantine was being close to her mother and Claxton’s 15-year-old son, Javier. But don’t expect wedding bells just yet, considering how difficult it is to plan during a pandemic.</p><p>Burrell said:</p><p>“We haven’t started talking about wedding planning yet because stuff is so up in the air,” “We just want to bask in the glow of this right now.” Anne Burrell is an American chef, TV personality and a teacher at the Institute of Culinary Education. She is best known for hosting the Food Network program ‘Secrets Of a Restaurant Chef’ and co-host of ‘Worst Cooks in America’.</p><p>Burrell makes restaurant dishes accessible and reveals concise, easy-to-master techniques for the at-home cook on her Food Network series Secrets of a Restaurant Chef. On her show Chef Wanted, Anne helps top restaurateurs find candidates with the right experience and creativity to become executive chefs. On Worst Cooks in America, Burrell joins Tyler Florence in mentoring teams of hopeless home cooks from around the country, putting them through culinary boot camp.</p><p>To add on that, the chef has earned some awards such as the 75,000 dollars for the fourth installment of the Chopped All-Stars Tournament for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation and won the “Food Network Personalities” preliminary round. Moreover, Burrell was nominated for the outstanding lifestyle/culinary host by the Daytime Emmy.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=stuart-claxton-career></span><span>Stuart Claxton Career</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Claxton works at Univision in the ad sales marketing department.
