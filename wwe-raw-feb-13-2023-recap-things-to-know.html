There were a couple of boring, meaningless matches, but there were also some very entertaining moments. It was an inconsistent show, to say the least.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="10 Things WWE Fans Need To Know About The Elimination Chamber PPV">10 Things WWE Fans Need To Know About The Elimination Chamber PPV</a></span>We had an amazing segment between two of the most over wrestlers in the world right now, Cody Rhodes and Sami Zayn, and also Brock Lesnar and Bobby Lashley had a fun contract signing. Bianca Belair, Becky Lynch and Bayley delivered a great match in the main event, and much more. Here are 10 things fans need to know about this week's WWE Raw.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-judgment-day-defeated-the-street-profits><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>The Judgment Day Defeated The Street Profits</span></h2><p>This Monday The Street Profits faced The Judgment Day's Finn Balor and Damian Priest. <a href=#>It was a very good match</a>, with solid in-ring action. Every man involved played his part and especially Balor and Ford stood out with their explosiveness and charisma. The end came when Angelo Dawkins attacked Dominik Mysterio, which allowed Finn Balor to hit a Coupe de Grace for the win. After the match, Edge and Beth Phoenix appeared, but Rhea Ripley also appeared to hit a Riptide on the Glamazon.</p><h2 id=bobby-lashley-speared-brock-lesnar-and-signed-the-contract><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Bobby Lashley Speared Brock Lesnar And Signed The Contract</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The contract signing segment for the match between <a href=#>Brock Lesnar</a> and Bobby Lashley was what everyone expected, violent. Lashley was smart and did things his way. He brought in several security guards and kept his distance. Then, The All-Mighty pissed Lesnar off, leading him right into his trap, as Lashley hit a powerful Spear on Lesnar and then signed the contract, making the match official.</p><h2 id=piper-niven-defeated-michin><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Piper Niven Defeated Michin</span></h2><p><a href=#>Piper Niven</a> has looked dominant since returning in the women's Royal Rumble match, but things hadn't quite worked out for her until this Monday. Niven managed to defeat Michin, scoring her first singles victory on the main roster since February 7, 2022. It was a short, but decent match, Michin did her best, but in the end she wasn't a match against the strength of Piper Niven.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cody-rhodes-amp-sami-zayn-delivered-a-world-class-segment><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Cody Rhodes & Sami Zayn Delivered A World-Class Segment</span></h2><p>Sami Zayn came to the ring and called out Cody Rhodes because he wanted to ask him if he really believed that <a href=#>Sami could defeat Roman Reigns</a>. Cody said that he actually did believe that Sami could beat Roman.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Cody Rhodesâ First 10 Matches Since His Return To WWE, Ranked From Worst To Best">Cody Rhodes’ First 10 Matches Since His Return To WWE, Ranked From Worst To Best</a></span></p><p>However, Sami doesn't trust himself, Sami doesn't know if he has what it takes to beat a guy who has gone over three years without being pinned, Sami isn't sure if he can against the man who operates in God mode. Cody then motivated Sami and told him that he hopes to see him at WrestleMania. <a href=#>The fans enjoyed this segment so much that they chanted "this is awesome"</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cody-rhodes-defeated-baron-corbin><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Cody Rhodes Defeated Baron Corbin</span></h2><p><a href=#>Baron Corbin said that he doesn't need JBL</a>, that he is the past and that he only gave him bad advice. Then, Corbin said that Sami Zayn had no chance against Roman Reigns, and recalled that he was the last man to pin Reigns.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="10 Weird Baron Corbin WWE Moments We Completely Forgot About">10 Weird Baron Corbin WWE Moments We Completely Forgot About</a></span></p><p>Corbin also said that Cody Rhodes will be another victim of Reigns, Corbin said that Rhodes is a clown who was given the 30th spot at the Royal Rumble and talked trash about his family. The American Nightmare was listening to every word, so he attacked Corbin, bringing him to the ring and ringing the bell. Cody Rhodes, dressed in a suit, defeated Baron Corbin without a hitch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=asuka-made-liv-morgan-tap-out><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Asuka Made Liv Morgan Tap Out</span></h2><p>SmackDown representatives Raquel Rodriguez, <a href=#>Liv Morgan</a> and Natalya faced off against RAW's Nikki Cross, Carmella and Asuka. Frankly it was a forgettable match, in which Asuka attacked everyone, even her own teammates, until she made Liv Morgan tap out to end the match. This match served to set up the women's Elimination Chamber match, making it clear that it's every woman for herself.</p><h2 id=bronson-reed-defeated-mustafa-ali><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Bronson Reed Defeated Mustafa Ali</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bronson Reed and Mustafa Ali went one-on-one this week. Ali told Dolph Ziggler that he would have beaten Bronson Reed to qualify for the Elimination Chamber match, so Reed put Ali to the test. Ali and Reed did a good job in the few minutes they had, Ali showed his fighting spirit and grit, but Reed prevailed with his destructive power.</p><h2 id=seth-rollins-talked-about-logan-paul><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Seth Rollins Talked About Logan Paul</span></h2><p>On this occasion Seth Rollins was the guest of Miz Tv. Rollins said that he is still pursuing his dream of headlining WrestleMania and also talked about Logan Paul. Rollins said that Paul is selfish, he doesn't care about sports entertainment, he only cares about money. It looks like <a href=#>we will have a match between Seth Rollins and Logan Paul</a> sooner rather than later. After that, Rollins hit a Stomp on The Miz, but Austin Theory hit his finisher on Rollins.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rick-boogs-squashed-the-miz-again><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Rick Boogs Squashed The Miz... Again</span></h2><p>On the January 30, 2023, episode of Monday Night Raw, <a href=#>Rick Boogs</a> crushed The Miz. Well, history repeated itself this week. The Miz was still hurt after receiving a Stomp from Seth Rollins, but still the bell rang and Boogs wasted no time in attacking The Miz. Boogs showed his extraordinary strength and defeated The Miz quickly.</p><h2 id=bianca-belair-defeated-becky-lynch-amp-bayley><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Bianca Belair Defeated Becky Lynch & Bayley</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The main event of this week's episode of Monday Night Raw was a Triple Threat Match between Bianca Belair, Becky Lynch and Bayley. If either Bayley or Becky won, they were added to the Elimination Chamber match. It was a great match overall, unpredictable and well-paced. There were certainly a couple of sloppy sequences, but there were also a couple of outstanding spots that were executed to perfection.</p><p>Dakota Kai and IYO SKY were helping Bayley, so all the women who are going to participate in the Elimination Chamber match came to the ring, forming a chaotic brawl. Belair took care of all the women, as she threw SKY right into all the women at ringside. If that wasn't enough, Belair performed a KOD on Becky Lynch onto Bayley, and pinned Bayley for the win. Then, Belair prevailed and neither Becky nor Bayley were added to the Elimination Chamber.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenrLJuvsCwZJ%2BdkmJ%2BdHmRaWlsZaKasKK8jK2foqaXqHq1u4ykpaivXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dwayne-dawkins-age-and-wikipedia-where-is-his-hometown-256323-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dwayne Dawkins Age And Wikipedia- Where Is His Hometown?">&larr;
