Not even in whispers. Not even in guarded allusions. Not even during pillow talk. The man obviously believes in the East German version of socialism, and the implication is that not even the Stasi can believe that. They are looking for dissent and subversion because, in a way, they think a man like Dreyman should be guilty of them. Perhaps they do not believe in East Germany themselves, but have simply chosen to play for the winning team.</description></item><item><title>Who dies in the Chainsaw Man season 1 finale?</title><link>/who-dies-in-the-chainsaw-man-season-1-finale.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/who-dies-in-the-chainsaw-man-season-1-finale.html</guid><description>Warning:&amp;nbsp;the following article contains spoilers for&amp;nbsp;Chainsaw Man season one,&amp;nbsp;episode eleven,&amp;nbsp;“Katana vs. Chainsaw.”

This is, in other words, the way most people have seen the film and the edit that garnered it its much-deserved cult status.&amp;nbsp;
Cronenberg had it all figured out at the dawn of home video: How a la carte programming would cater to and thus embolden niche communities; how consumer-grade video products would permanently alter content; how pornography is a progressive addiction not in the sense of social progress, but in the way a cancer progresses through a body, hungrier and stranger, deadlier too, as time goes on.</description></item><item><title>Calendar Girls movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2022)</title><link>/calendar-girls-movie-review-2022.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/calendar-girls-movie-review-2022.html</guid><description>Like the 2003 narrative film also called&amp;nbsp;“Calendar Girls,” based on the true story of a Yorkshire women’s group that produced a calendar with older ladies in tastefully nude poses, and like the documentary “Young at Heart,” about residents in assisted living performing contemporary songs like “I Want a New Drug,” this is a movie about finding meaning and connection near the end of life.
